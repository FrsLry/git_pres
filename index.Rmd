# Version control: what is (G)it?

**Version Control:**

.center[
*Program responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large 
websites or other collection of information*
]

--

<br>
- Git was created Linus Torvalds in 2005

- You can backup **versions** (*i.e.* "snapshots") of a file/directory

- A version is called a **commit**

- Each commit is identified by a unique **tag** and a **message**

--

.pull-left[
<br><br>
**Allows you to come back to a specific commit**
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics("images/version_control.jpg")

```

]

---

# What is Github?

.center[
**The online version of Git**
]

--

<br><br>

- You can send your files and their versions online

--

<br>
- Essential for collaboration/teamwork

--

<br>
- Safe way to store your data/work on several devices

# How to use Git?


---

# Initialize your repository

<br>
- **Repository** = directory where the versions of the files will be managed by Git

--

<br>
- This is the very first necessary step

--

<br>
- For this, use `git init` in your Command Line Interface

--

<br>
- Now, a hidden directory `.git` can be found at the root of your project

--

<br>
.center[
**Don't ever modify this directory directly,<br>this is where all your backups are!!!!!**
]
---

# Your first commit

- First of all, the most useful command:

``` 

git status

```

--

Will tell you the *branch* you are on, the *deleted*, *modified*, *created* files, if the local commits are pushed, which changes are **staged**...

--

- **Stage** the changes using:

``` 

git add name_file_1 name_file_2 ... name_file_n  # if you want to stage specific changes, or
git add .                                        # if you want to stage every changes

```
--

- **Commit** using:

```shell 

git commit                      # a text editor will open where you can write the commit message. Or,
git commit -m "Commit message"  # if you want to write directly the commit message

```



---

# Branches

.pull-left[
<br><br><br><br><br>
```{r, echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics("images/branch.png")

```
]

--

.pull-right[

- At first, you will just see the branch `master`

``` 
git branch 
  * master
```

- You can create new branches

```
git branch new_branch_name
```

- And switch between branches


``` 
git checkout name_branch
Switched to branch 'name_branch'
```
- **Most importantly, you can merge branches together**

From the `main` branch, use:

```
git merge new_branch
```

]

---

# Useful tips


## Ignore files

- You can specify the files/directories that you never want to commit in the `.gitignore` file


--
<br>
## Check your commits

- Using:

``` 

git log             # or
git log --oneline   # or
git reflog

```


---

# Undo your commits

.center[
**There are different ways to do it but the most common one is reset**
]

--

- `git reset` is dangerous: you go back to the desired commit and "erase" all the commit created since 

```

git reset --hard <SHA>

```

However, you can bypass this by using:

```
git reset --hard <previous-SHA>
git reset --soft <last-SHA>
```

--

- `git checkout` allows to create a temporary branch with the commit wanted


``` 

git checkout <SHA>

```

# Advantages of Reproducible Science
<br><br>
- Share your results

- Work with collaborators

- Avoid mistakes

- Peer reviewing


???

The means have been computed in a weird way.

They didn't use some data that had a high GDP growth with a debt higher than a 100% (we don't know why)

The most important: there was as mistake in on of the excel formula 

After correction: 2.2% instead of the 0%

**All of this using Git/Github/Gitlab**
]

# Publish your local repository online

.pull-left[

- Create a repository on Github

<br><br>
- Click on the clipboad to copy the remote

]



.pull-right[
```{r, echo=F, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/repo-create.png")
```
<br>
![](images/copy-remote-repository-url-quick-setup.png)
]

--

- Now, `push` your existing repository from the command line:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/user_name/repo_name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

--
<br>
.center[
**From now on, you will be able to publish your commits using** `git push`

**Also, you can dowload the modifications that are published on Github by using** `git pull`
]

---

# Clone a github repository


.center[
**Nothing more simple**
]

--

<br><br>

- Go on your favorite Github repository

<br><br>

- Copy the URL of this repository

<br><br>

- Clone it from the command line using:

```
git clone https://github.com/user_name/repo_name.git
```



---

# Forking a github repository

- A fork is a personal copy of a github repository

<br><br>

- It create a new independent repository that you can modify as much as you want, without modifying the original repo

<br><br>

- Also, you can ask to merge your modifications to the original repo using a `pull request`

---

# Github pages

- A really cool feature of Github is that you can create an HTML page for a repository



<br>

- For this, go in *Settings > Options > Github Pages*



<br>

- Select the branch and the folder that contains the .html file



<br>

- Github will automatically look for a file named `index.html` to build from

# Tips for git installation


* You can either spam `next` and then click `install`


.center[
**Or**
]

* Uncheck the `Additional icons` and `Windows Explorer integration` features (they are cumbersome)

# Tips for git installation


* Here you can choose the text editor used for commits, picking and squashing... By default, Git is set up to use Vim (and you need to know Vim commands to use it)

#  Tips for git installation

* Last but not least: here you can set up Git in order to also use shell commands (and not only commands specific to your OS). It also allows the (very very) cool `Julia`'s feature to use shell commands directly in the `Julia` REPL

# One last thing

<br>

* If you just installed Git on your computer, it may come useful to specify your name and email address to Git using:

```

git config --global user.name "Your name"

git config --global user.email "address@domain"

```

<br>

* Now, you should be able to see these changes using:

```

git config --global --list

```
